Shopping Cart application
Enhance the shopping cart application from Chapter 16 and implement it using
GUI or Web and Sqlite3 as learned in chapters 17 and 18. Create and include
a SQL script that populates the database and use the prepopulated inventory for
the shopping cart actions. You will need to design a UI that allows the user to
view the products available and then be able to add / remove items from the
cart. User will have the option to checkout from the cart and place the order,
which will then show a screen with the order placed along with the total cost.
